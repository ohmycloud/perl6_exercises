NOTES {#{{{

    INSPECTING
        my $var = "foobar";
        say $var.WHAT;          # (Str)
        say $var.perl;          # "foobar"  <- the quotes actually get printed.
        say $var;               # foobar

    SIGILS
        These are mostly familiar and comfortable.

    TWIGILS
        These are completely new to perl6, and can modify the scope of a 
        variable.  Absolutely read and re-read this section:
            http://doc.perl6.org/language/variables#Twigils
