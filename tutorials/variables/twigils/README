- dynamic.p6
    *   dynamic

- specvar.p6
    ?   are compile-time variables ($?FILE, $?LINE)
    *   are dynamic, but some are available in your program.  I assume these
            dynamic variables are run-time, not compile-time.

- class.p6
    !   attribute
    .   method (not really a variable)

- params.p6
    ^   positional parameter
    :   named parameter



<   index into match object (not really a variable)
=   POD variables (don't care for now)
~   sublanguage (basically unimplemented at this point)
