CHECK
I definitely need to spend some more time in here playing with this stuff 
until it penetrates.

Definitely look for CH.ECK marks in ./, as well as NY.I marks.


Avoid Thread and Scheduler {#{{{
    p6 has high-level APIs (which will be covered below).  The Thread and 
    Scheduler APIs are lower-level.

    Some p6 features may implicitly operate asynchronously.  So you're 
    encouraged to avoid those low-level APIs to keep from getting in the way 
    of these implicitly asynchronous features.

Promise {#{{{
    Sometimes called a "future" in other languages.

    See ./promise.p6

    trying a promise
        This code appears in the sample script several times to see what 
        happened to a broken promise:
                try $p.result;
                say $p.cause;
        The cause() method is used in those cases with no checking, because 
        it's an example script.  But that cause() method will itself throw an 
        exception if the promise did not break.  So I expect we'd need to look 
        at $p.cause inside a CATCH block.  However, we haven't gotten to 
        exception handling yet, so I don't know how to do that yet.

        So just keep in mind that you can't call $p.cause wherever you want.

Supplies {#{{{

    A Supply is an "asynchronous data streaming mechanism".  Sounds like a 
    form of event programming.

    ./supplies.p6

}#}}}
Channels {#{{{

    A thread-safe queue that can have multiple readers and writers.

    A channel is a fifo.  After a message has been read once, it's gone.  To 
    allow multiple readers to read a single message, use a Supply instead.

Proc::Async {#{{{
    I thought this sounded like a replacement for fork, but no.

    It's essentially a replacement for system().
}#}}}
Low-level APIs {
    The start of the Concurrency section warned me against using these.  So I 
    probably won't bother making a test script, but do want to at least read 
    the section once so it's been pasteurized.
