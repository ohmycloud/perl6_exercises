Modules, classes, grammars ("and others") are packages.



The docs make it look like it might be possible to do this:
        my $mod = 'Linux';
        use <$mod>::CurrentOS;

    ...but alas, it's not.



There's some other info at the URL about package variables, none of which I care about ATM.
