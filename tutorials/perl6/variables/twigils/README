Dynamic * {#{{{

    dynamic.p6
    specvar.p6

    Pulls the value of the variable by this name from the perspective of the 
    caller.  The variable does not need to appear in the signature.

            sub greet() {
                say "Hi, $*name.";
            }
            {
                my $*name = "jon";
                greet();
            }
            {
                my $*name = "kermit";
                greet();
            }
            exit;

    Outputs:
        Hi, jon.
        Hi, kermit.


    Why would you not just do
            sub greet($name) { say "Hi, $name." }
            greet('jon');
            greet('kermit');

        which is far less confusing?  You got me.



    Some of these dynamic vars are known to your program at runtime, like
            $*CWD
            $*ARGS
            $*PROGRAM

        Do go look at ./specvar.p6 for more info.

Attribute ! {#{{{

    class.p6

    Refers to the value of an attribute in a class.  Only accessible within 
    the class itself.

            class Jontest {
                has $!var = 42;
                method stuff() {
                    say $!var;
                }
            }

            my $j = Jontest.new();

        We can call this method, which itself accesses its own internal $!var:
            $j.stuff();                 # 42

        But we can't access $!var directly from the outside:
            say $j!var;                 # compile error
            say $j.var;                 # runtime error (method not found)

    See also the Method twigil (.) which allows us to access this value from 
    the outside.
    
}#}}}
Compile-time ? {#{{{

    ./specvar.p6

    http://doc.perl6.org/language/variables#Compile-time_variables
            Lists all of these types of variables.  Vaguely interesting, but 
            $?FILE and $?LINE are probably the ones you'll use most (and 
            you'll probably use those very infrequently).
    
    These are known to the compiler and cannot be modified.

            say $?FILE;         # /full/path/to/file.p6
            say $?LINE;         # 19

    The docs say that these cannot be changed at runtime, but can be 
    redefined:
            constant $?TABSTOP = 4;

        I assume that "constant" declarations are handled at compile time 
        rather than runtime, which is the distinction here.

        This also DOES NOT WORK as of 6.c.  The error tells me that doing this 
        is not yet implemented.
        
        No big deal.

}#}}}
Method . {#{{{
    
    class.p6

    When you define a variable in a class using a . what you're really doing 
    is defining a $! variable by the same name, and also defining a simple 
    accessor:
            
            class Jontest {
                has $.var = 42;

                method stuff() {
                    "My var is set to $!var.";
                }
            }

            my $j = Jontest.new();

        So even though we never specifically declared $!var, calling this 
        method, which accesses $!var, shows that it does exist:
            say stuff();

        But now, since we declared it using $., we have an accessor method 
        that we can use from the outside:
            say $j.var;


    This is an ACCESSOR-ONLY method.
            $j.var = 3;         # GONNNG!  Cannot modify an immutable...


    If we wanted Jontest::var() to also be a Mutator, we would have had to 
    declare it as having the rw trait:

            class Jontest {
                has $.var is rw = 42;
            }

            my $j = Jontest.new();
            say $j.var;                 # 42
            $j.var = 3;                 # No problem, it's rw
            say $j.var;                 # 3

}#}}}
Match < {#{{{
    
    The tut says this is just an alias for $/<...> where $/ is the match 
    variable, and then links off to the Match type docu:
        doc.perl6.org/type/Match

    There's not much else said, so this is a little hazy.

}#}}}
Positional ^ {#{{{

    The caret can be used in two ways.


    RANGE {#{{{
        http://doc.perl6.org/type/Range

        It can be used to create a range from 0 up to (but not including) N.

        Or, put another way, it can be used to create a range starting at 0 
        and of length N.

                my $var = ^4;
                say $var.WHAT;          # (Range)
                say $var.min;           # 0
                say $var.max;           # 4
                say $var;               # ^4

                ### It stringifies to a list
                say "-$var-";           # -0 1 2 3-

                for $var -> $a {
                    ### A range is NOT iterable.  It just returns itself in
                    ### this for loop which runs only one time.
                    say $a;             # ^4
                }

                for $var.list -> $a {
                    say "-$a-";

                    ### There we go - turn that range into a list first, then
                    ### iterate _that_.
                    ###
                    ### Output is as expected:
                    ### -0-
                    ### -1-
                    ### -2-
                    ### -3-
                }


    }#}}}
    POSITIONAL {#{{{

        Here's where it gets a little goofy.  

        In a block or routine, a caret twigil indicates an incoming positional 
        parameter.  The name portion of the variable (the alpha chars after 
        the sigil and twigil) determine which variable holds which value.

        These can be used in routines, but since routines have signatures, 
        we'll generally use those rather than these positional parameters.  So 
        you _can_ use these caret variables in routines, but "can" does not 
        imply "should", and you generally won't.


        This is usually used when we're iterating over a hash or array.
                my %hash = (
                    jon => 'barton',
                    kermit => 'jackson',
                );
                %hash.kv.map({ say "$^b, $^a" });

                # Outputs:
                # barton, jon
                # jackson, kermit


        The "goofiness" is here -- "a" comes before "b" in a sort, so $^a is 
        the first positional parameter, and $^b is the second.  That's it.


        It's not uncommon to see code like this:
                %hash.kv.map({ say "$^v, $^k" });

            or:
                %hash.kv.map({ say "$^value, $^key" });

            We used "k" and "v" (or "key" and "value") to indicate the key and 
            value coming out of the .kv method.

            But the only reason that works is that .kv returns its values in 
            the order (key, value), and "k" just happens to come before "v" in 
            English.
            
            So it works, but not because there's anything special about the 
            "k" or the "v".  Any of these would have returned the same thing:
                %hash.kv.map({ say "$^b, $^a" });
                %hash.kv.map({ say "$^z, $^q" });
                %hash.kv.map({ say "$^r, $^e" });
                %hash.kv.map({ say "$^stuff, $^cake" });

            
    }#}}}
                
    See ./params.p6 which explains this better.

}#}}}
Named : (dumb, doesn't work) {#{{{
    
    Like the positional ^, this is a little goofy.  Also like ^, there are 
    better ways than using this twigil when dealing with routines, so you'll 
    likely only use this in blocks, if at all.

    So we can do this:
            sub greet {
                say "Hi, $:name";
            }
            greet(name => 'jon');


    But that's fucking stupid when you could have done this, explicitly 
    stating the named variable in the signature:
            sub greet(:$name) {
                say "Hi, $name";
            }
            greet(name => 'jon');

        Note that we are using the colon there, but it's not a twigil.


    The single example given in the tut of using this in a block is dumb, and 
    it doesn't work in 6.c.

POD = (doesn't work) {#{{{

    Supposedly, this should work:

            =begin Foobar

            Some POD goes here.

            =end Foobar

            say $=Foobar;
