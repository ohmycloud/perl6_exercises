This is not a section of the tutorial.  

I assume this stuff will be covered by some part of the tutorial at some 
point, but the rest of the tut keeps using this stuff before it's been 
covered.


my $num = 4;
my $str = 'foobar';

say $num.^name;     # Int
say $str.^name;     # Str

say $num.WHAT;     # (Int)
say $str.WHAT;     # (Str)

say $num.perl;     # 4
say $str.perl;     # "foobar"       (the quotes do get displayed)

say $num.gist;     # 4
say $str.gist;     # foobar         (the quotes do NOT get displayed)
