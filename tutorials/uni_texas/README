Unicode properties resources {#{{{

    Full explanation of the properties.  Unfortunately, the way this info is 
    laid out is pretty bad.  I'm not seeing any simple listing of properties 
    such as Ll or Lu as mentioned in the p6 docu.
        http://unicode.org/reports/tr44/#Properties

    You'd think "unicode.org" would be a better resource that 
    "fileformat.info", but this page has a much clearer listing of the 
    properties as discussed in the p6 docs:
        http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/category/index.htm

    List of all unicode chars, in alpha order, as well as a search.  Each char 
    gets its own page fully listing out that char's info, including its 
    property/category:
        http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/a.htm

Alphabetic characters {#{{{
    Any Unicode character that has the Ll or Lu property can be used in p6 in 
    the same way as any ASCII letter.

Unicode/Texas equivalents in p6 {#{{{
    
    Contains a table listing out character equivalencies in p6, eg « can be 
    written as just << and ÷ can be written as / etc

    Some interesting ones:

        - Any superscript from 0 to 9 can be written as either:
                say 2² == 2**2;         # True
                say 2⁹ == 2**9;         # True

            <Ctrl-K> 2 S
            <Ctrl-K> 9 S

            ...lower-case "s" gives you a subscript (eg ₂) instead of a 
            superscript. 

    Otherwise, see the table.
