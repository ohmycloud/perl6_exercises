Bailador is Spanish for "dancer".

It's an attempt to imitate p5's Dancer.  I'm not sure if it's eventually meant 
for production use, or is just a proof of concept, I suspect the latter.  But 
perl6maven.com is using it, so it is at least partially usable in production.



There's not a ton of info here yet, but it's enough to create a few examples.
    http://perl6maven.com/bailador



test.p6
    Several basic routes.  All work.  See the code for URLs.

post.p6
    Root route displays a form that POSTs back to itself.  Works.

get.p6
    Root route displays a form that GETs back to itself.  Works.

tmpl.p6
    The perl6maven page I took this from is:
        http://perl6maven.com/echo-text-with-bailador-using-template-mojo
    But Gabor misspelled the link (from the main bailador page) in to that 
    page - he missed the ending 'e' in 'template'.  

    Otherwise, it works.  Template is in ./views/echo.tt
