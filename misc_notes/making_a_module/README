The whole module system isn't mature yet, like it is for p5.  There's a 
PAUSE-like system in the works, but not available yet.

In the meantime, p6 folks appear to mainly be keeping their code in github.


There are some tools available to help with making a module:

Terminology and URLs {#{{{

    https://github.com/perl6/ecosystem/
        This repo contains, mainly, a META.list file which contains URLs to 
        the module project pages.

        I assume, when you say "hey p6 go install Some::Module", the module 
        installer first consults that META.list file to figure out where 
        Some::Module lives, and then goes and retrieves and installs it.
        
    panda
        p6 module installer.  Like cpan or cpanm.  I've used this, it seems 
        fine.

    zef
        Another p6 module installer.  I haven't used this.

    https://github.com/perl6/perl6-most-wanted/blob/master/most-wanted/modules.md
        P6 "Most Wanted Modules" list.  If you're looking to create a module 
        but don't know what to write, this list gives suggestions.

Files in a module {#{{{

    These are the files allowed in your module.  Obviously this list is 
    partially meta:
            META6.json
            README.md
            .travis.yml
            .gitignore
            bin/baker.p6
            lib/Bread/Baker.pm6
            resources/recipe.txt
            t/00-test-bake.t
            xt/00-ensure-bread-is-tasty.t

    bin/
        scripts, executables

    lib/
        modules

    resources/
        templates, images, etc.

    t/
        user-run tests

    xt/
        author-run tests
        these tests are not run as part of the install process.

    .travis.yml
        Travis testing is encouraged.
        https://travis-ci.org/

    META6.json
        "Most important of all".  Specifies prereqs, authorship, what your 
        module does, etc.

        All keys allowed in this file:
            http://design.perl6.org/S22.html#META6.json

        A sample META6.json file:
            https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoffixznet/perl6-IO-MiddleMan/master/META6.json

        The Raw link to this file is the URL that goes into the META.list file 
        in the perl6/ecosystem/ repo mentioned above.

    .gitignore, README.md
        You know what these are.

Ecosystem Future {#{{{
    
    The plan is to get a PAUSE-like setup working.  And it sounds like it's 
    partially there now.  The bottom of zoffix's blog post includes some brief 
    info on how to upload a p6 module to pause right now.  See the blog for 
    info.
