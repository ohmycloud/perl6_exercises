one.p6
    Sets up the string we're dealing with, along with a grammar that matches 
    it.

    Includes some output lines to show that everything is working.

    Note that variables are poorly named.  'question' should be 'entry', and 
    'header' should be 'question'.  I didn't change them because the tut is 
    using the goofy names and I'd have to continuously translate in my head 
    and that'd cause confusion.


two.p6
    Copied from one.p6, with additional debug-y output removed.

    Adds a Question class and a Question::Answer class.

    After parsing the questions and answers out of our string using the 
    Grammar from one.p6, this version then creates Question objects, each of 
    which contains several Question::Answer objects.

    This script works and it's easy to see what it's doing, but the way it's 
    doing what it's doing isn't "right" (I mean it works, but it's not 
    perl6-y.)

three.p6
    Copied from two.p6.

    Does the same job as two.p6, but instead of iterating over our match 
    object, this adds an Action class to the Grammar itself.

    ***
    This part of the tutorial is the first tut I've seen yet that actually 
    tries to explain what make() is doing.
    Re-read and understand this.
