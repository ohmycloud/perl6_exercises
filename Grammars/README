I've been getting a little lost on how Grammars work, and I think it's due to 
me not understanding the Actions aspect.

    A Grammar is a set of rules to match a string.  A class for regexes.

    A Grammar can also modify its matched string using Actions.



The first part is understandable - I get what's happening.  The Actions part 
is what's confusing me, but I don't want to ignore Grammars because I don't 
understand that bit.

So at least work on fully grokking the "class of regexes" bit for now.


Tutorials {#{{{

    There's an advent calendar exercise on Grammars and Actions here:
        https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2009/12/21/day-21-grammars-and-actions/   

        I'd been avoiding it since it's from 2009, but so far it's the best 
        walkthrough of Grammars and actions I've seen.

        DrForr (Jeff Goff) has a (planned) 6-part blog on Grammars.
        I've gone through parts 1 and 2 as of 02/19.  Come back and go through 
        the rest as he writes them.

        I haven't read part 3 yet, and it's up.

Rules of Grammar {#{{{

    This isn't being spelled out anywhere, it's the best I'm able to derive 
    from observation.
    
    - The TOP rule runs automatically when we try to parse a string with the 
      Grammar

    - A rule is made up of other rules and tokens.
        - Whitespace is important for rules.
        - :sigspace is on.

    - A token is meant to be more atomic than a rule, though a token can 
      contain other tokens and rules.
        - Whitespace is NOT important for tokens.
        - :sigspace is off.

url.p6 {#{{{

    I got most of the code in here more or less from
        https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Perl_6_Programming/Grammars

    This contains three different grammars which all match the structure of a 
    URL.

    All three are variations on the same idea, matching a URL.

    Note the "proto" token in ProtoURL.

    Also note how I had to change the "subdomain" from a rule to a regex in 
    OptionalSubdomainURL.

url_rule.p6 {#{{{
    
    Still messing with the URL grammar from ./url.p6 but now I'm trying to 
    modify the URL using an Actions class.

    The URL _is_ getting modified, but not in the way I want it to.  See the 
    comments in the code.
