This is a blog series on Grammars.  There are only two parts written at this 
point, but I'm hoping he keeps with it and plan to come back here to follow 
along.


part1
    Blah.  This is not a tutorial on Grammars in p6 aimed at p5 programmers.  
    The entirety of part1 is "this is what a regular expression is, for those 
    who have never seen one before", and goes on to write some p6 regexen to 
    match an ISO 8601 timestamp.
    Not helpful at all so far.

part2
    Just a continuation of part1.  He hasn't touched on grammars yet, and is 
    still trying to explain how regexen work.
    Still not helpful.
    
part3
    http://theperlfisher.blogspot.nl/2016/02/from-regular-expressions-to-grammars-pt_20.html

    He still hasn't used the word "Grammar" anywhere in this post.  

    This post is more than just a regex refresher, though.  It's a very good 
    handheld walkthrough on building up some complex parsing rules 

part4
    Hasn't been posted yet.
