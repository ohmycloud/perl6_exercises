Junctions were not covered in the tutorial with the rest of the stuff in ../, 
but I just found reference to them and this seemed as good a place as any to 
put my notes.

A junction is a variable that can have multiple values.


The junctive operations (see test.p6) run in what's called "junctive 
autothreading".  So junctions thread out on their own for performance.  You 
don't have to do anything for this to happen.
