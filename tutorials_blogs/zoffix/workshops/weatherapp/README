Waiting on part 4

    Since some are asking: I stopped my "Weather App" article series because I 
    wasn't having fun writing them. Sorry :) 

Well, shit.


Part I {#{{{
    http://perl6.party/post/Perl-6-Hands-On-Workshop--Weatherapp--Part-1

    No code at all, just initialization.  Setting up a git repo, deciding our 
    requirements, signing up for an API key, etc.
}#}}}
Part II {#{{{
    http://perl6.party/post/Perl-6-Hands-On-Workshop--Weatherapp--Part-2

    Another whole blog post on the importance of design documents.  I mean, I 
    get it, but I want to use this is a p6 tutorial, not a daily 
    "how-to-make-da-software".
}#}}}
Part III {#{{{
    March 29
    http://perl6.party/post/Perl-6-Hands-On-Workshop--Weatherapp--Part-3

    Still no module code, but he sets up his testing structure, and uses some 
    test modules I haven't fiddled with yet, so there's value here.

    Test with
        prove -e 'perl6 -Ilib' -vr t/

    He's using TDD.  OK.  Installing (via panda):
        Test::When
        Test::META
}#}}}
Part IV {
    July 27, still no part 4.  Has he given up on this?
}

API {#{{{
    My API key from www.openweathermap.com:
        245ab8901be060d13e97ee4a6ba6697a

    My login info is in keepassx.
