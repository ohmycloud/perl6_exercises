JDB

"./configure && make && make check && make install" installs to 
/usr/local/lib/ which it appears that NativeCall does not search in.  I copied 
libcsv.so.3 to /usr/lib/ and my test script then worked.  

There's gotta be a way to tell NativeCall to look in other places, but I dunno 
what that way is yet.
