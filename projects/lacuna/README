- Need to add logging

- Need to change all module extensions to ".pm6" and delete my vim modelines.
    - Just change the filenames - nothing in the code needs to change.



Only GL::Account does Comms now.  GL::Model no longer does Comms.




- I'm having a tough time breaking Building.pm out into constituent modules.  
  I put everything back (into the single Building.pm), and test.p6 now works 
  again.
    - But I really need to get that broken out.
    - While working on that, see Body/OwnBodyRole.  It's creating a Body 
      object, which is part of what's causing the problem.  It might be worth 
      creating a temporary Body class actually inside OwnBodyRole until I can 
      get the Building stuff straightened out.



Classes to add {#{{{

    - Empire.pm
    - Building.pm
    - Ship.pm
        - These need to be factories like Body.pm is.
        - Body.pm (and possibly other classes) includes its own little 
          mini-ship and empire utility classes.  Those ultimately need to go 
          away, to be replaced by mini-classes in Empire.pm and Ship.pm.  
          These "mini-classes" need to be similar to the ForeignBody class in 
          Body.pm.

HTTP Traffic {#{{{
    Using Net::HTTP, some https requests fail, some succeed.  Not sure what 
    the difference is.  Fetching captcha images fails.
        This is now fixed; see the OpenSSL section below.

    I tried switching to HTTP::UserAgent.  In tests, it's able to access https 
    URLs that Net::HTTP is not.

    However, HTTP::UserAgent isn't POSTing properly.  When I send "params" to 
    a TLE server, it must be sent as an array, and HTTP::UserAgent is sending 
    it as a single scalar value (at least when there's only a single param).  
    TLE won't accept that - it requires a single-element array.
}#}}}
OpenSSL {#{{{
    
    For a full explanation, see ../../modules/Net/HTTP/README.

    The short explanation is that the actual OpenSSL.pm used by Net::HTTP is  
    not able to access TLE https servers.  I had to hack at OpenSSL.pm to get 
    it to work, and that hacked copy is what's in ./lib/ and is what's being 
    used by this TLE client for HTTPS network traffic.

    My hack is naive, and is likely to cause problems with hitting https URLs 
    other than TLE.  Plus, it could well blow up at any time if the TLE 
    servers get re-configured.
