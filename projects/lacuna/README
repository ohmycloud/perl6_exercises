- Need to add logging

Classes to add {#{{{

    - Empire.pm
    - Building.pm
    - Ship.pm
        - These need to be factories like Body.pm is.
        - Body.pm (and possibly other classes) includes its own little 
          mini-ship and empire utility classes.  Those ultimately need to go 
          away, to be replaced by mini-classes in Empire.pm and Ship.pm.  
          These "mini-classes" need to be similar to the ForeignBody class in 
          Body.pm.

HTTP Traffic {#{{{
    Using Net::HTTP, some https requests fail, some succeed.  Not sure what 
    the difference is.  Fetching captcha images fails.
        This is now fixed; see the OpenSSL section below.

    I tried switching to HTTP::UserAgent.  In tests, it's able to access https 
    URLs that Net::HTTP is not.

    However, HTTP::UserAgent isn't POSTing properly.  When I send "params" to 
    a TLE server, it must be sent as an array, and HTTP::UserAgent is sending 
    it as a single scalar value (at least when there's only a single param).  
    TLE won't accept that - it requires a single-element array.
}#}}}
OpenSSL {#{{{
    
    For a full explanation, see ../../modules/Net/HTTP/README.

    The short explanation is that the actual OpenSSL.pm used by Net::HTTP is  
    not able to access TLE https servers.  I had to hack at OpenSSL.pm to get 
    it to work, and that hacked copy is what's in ./lib/ and is what's being 
    used by this TLE client for HTTPS network traffic.

    My hack is naive, and is likely to cause problems with hitting https URLs 
    other than TLE.  Plus, it could well blow up at any time if the TLE 
    servers get re-configured.
