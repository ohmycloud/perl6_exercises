Classes to add {#{{{

    - Empire.pm
    - Ship.pm
        - Both of these need to be factories like Body.pm is.
        - Body.pm (and possibly other classes) includes its own little 
          mini-ship and empire utility classes.  Those ultimately need to go 
          away, to be replaced by mini-classes in Empire.pm and Ship.pm.  
          These "mini-classes" need to be similar to the ForeignBody class in 
          Body.pm.
