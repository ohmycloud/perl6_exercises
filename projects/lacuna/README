Left off working on the public and private profiles.  They should be working, 
but need confirmation before checking them off as done.



Classes to add {#{{{

    - date
        I don't have a date class yet, so I'm storing dates as Str and trying 
        to remember to mark the assignments as "CHECK date".  

        I need to change those to use a date class that can translate from TLE 
        date format into something p6 understands.

    - Alliance
        Empire.pm - profile class

    - Medal
        Empire.pm - profile class

    - Planet
        Empire.pm - profile class

}#}}}
