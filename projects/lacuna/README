- Need to add logging

- Some (most) models will have methods that need to be able to talk to the 
  server (eg a PrivateProfile needs an edit() method).  But a few models (eg 
  Medal) are just collections of data and will not ever need to talk to the 
  server.
    - These "non-talking" models will have $!json_parsed attributes, but don't 
      need $!endpoint or $!account attributes.  I should set up a non-comm 
      Model role.

Classes to add {#{{{

    - date
        I don't have a date class yet, so I'm storing dates as Str and trying 
        to remember to mark the assignments as "CHECK date".  

        I need to change those to use a date class that can translate from TLE 
        date format into something p6 understands.

    - Comms
        - Exists as a class, but I think this should become a role instead.

    - Alliance
        Empire.pm - profile class

    - Medal
        Empire.pm - profile class

    - Planet
        Empire.pm - profile class

}#}}}
