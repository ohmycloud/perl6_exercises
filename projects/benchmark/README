This directory was copied from ../process_files_in_chunks/.  ./bench.p6 used 
to be channel_process.p6, just renamed and modified.


This is not meant to be a real benchmark that you'd publish somewhere.  It 
just shows major differences in runtime of this particular script.


To run it, simply:
    $ ./bench.p6
