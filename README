I have a symlink from perl6 to "six", so this will work:
    $ six hello.p6

    ...My fingers just don't want to reach for the 6 after typing "perl".  And 
    when they do start to reach for it, they invariably hit the 5 instead of 
    the 6 the first three times.  So fuck it, just call it "six".  

    Shit.  This doesn't work, since rakudobrew's "perl6" is actually just a 
    shell script that's assuming the name of the actual executable ("perl6") 
    should be the same as the name of the shell script being invoked.  Deal 
    with this at some point.


INSTALLING {#{{{
    http://rakudo.org/how-to-get-rakudo/

    I didn't want to go with the Ubuntu package, figuring it'd probably be 
    out-of-date.  I do like perlbrew, and one of the options for perl6 is 
    "rakudobrew", so figured I'd go with that instead of doing a full manual 
    build.


    $ git clone git@github.com:tadzik/rakudobrew.git ~/.rakudobrew
        - add ~/.rakudobrew/bin/ to your PATH

    - If you pulled my latest fish config file from github and started a new 
      shell, you can skip this next step; it's in that file.
        $ rakudobrew init
            This produces output, telling you how to auto-initialize on login.  
            Presumably the instructions given will init rakudo without 
            producing the pesky output.

    $ rakudobrew build moar
        Builds and installs the MoarVM.  It doesn't matter where you're 
        sitting on the filesystem when you do this.  Takes a few minutes.

    $ rakudobrew build-panda
        Builds and installs panda.  YES, THE HYPHEN NEEDS TO BE THERE.  Yes, 
        it's inconsistent.  Panda seems to be the rakudo moral equivalent of 
        cpan.  Takes a few minutes, less than building moar.

    $ panda install Task::Star
        "Meta-package for modules included in Rakudo Star"

        This produced an error on installing Grammar::Debugger.  Task::Star is 
        a list of modules to install, and I'm concerned that the entire list 
        stopped getting installed when the Grammar::Debugger error was 
        encountered.

        Task::Star comes from here:
            https://github.com/tadzik/Task-Star
        You can see the list of modules it's supposed to install in META.info.

        If you find that you need other modules that should have been included 
        in Task::Star but didn't get installed because of the 
        Grammar::Debugger explosion, you can install them individually as 
        needed:
            $ panda install JSON::Tiny
            $ panda install HTTP::Easy
            etc

    Anyway, Task::Star errors aside, "perl6" should now be in your path.
        $ which perl6
        /home/jon/.rakudobrew/bin/perl6
        
    Test!
        $ perl6 hello.p6
        Hello, World!

        Yay!

IDENTIFIERS {#{{{
    Names can include letters and numbers, but must start with a letter.

    They can also now include dashes and single-quotes, but only one at a 
    time.  And the first character after a dash or single-quote must again be 
    a letter.

    So these are valid identifiers:
        long-name
        don't
        long-a5s-name

    But these aren't:
        long--name
        long-75s-name

MODULES {#{{{
    https://modules.perl6.org/

    Install with
        $ panda install <MODULENAME>


    v5 (Run Perl5 inside Perl6 script) {#{{{
        Allows you to run Perl5 code inside Perl6.

            ...perl6 code...

            use v5;
            if( $^O eq 'MSWin32' ) {
                say "What are you thinking?!?";
            }

            use 6.0.0;
            ...more perl6 code...

        v5 is a "slang", which likely means it's going to be a subset of 
        perl5.

        See also Inline::Perl5, which embeds a perl5 interpreter, likely 
        allowing you to run real perl5 code.

    }#}}}
}#}}}
TRUTH {#{{{
    Looks like truth is mostly like perl5.

    HOWEVER, the string "0" is TRUE in perl6.

    perl6 also has an actual Boolean type.
        if True  {
            say "Hello";
        }
}#}}}
TUTORIALS {#{{{
    http://doc.perl6.org/language.html

    This page is a list of links to different perl6 tutorials and docs sites.  
    Looks pretty useful.

}#}}}
UNIMPLEMENTED *** {#{{{
    I'm starting to play with perl6 before the Xmas 2015 official production 
    release.
        This is rakudo version 2015.11-357-g587f700 built on MoarVM version 2015.11-34-gc3eea17 implementing Perl v6.b.

    I'm finding things that aren't doing what the docs tell me they should; 
    I'm going to just assume those things will be fixed in v1.0.

    Ack for "NYI" for things that fit this bill.
}#}}}
WHITESPACE {#{{{

    Whitespace rules are similar to perl5, but not identical.

    This one is going to burn me for quite a while.  You now NEED a space 
    after a keyword, like if or while.  So this is no longer valid:
        if( True ) {
            say "It's true."
        }
     
     That'll blow up because there's no space between the 'f' and the opening 
     paren.

     To make up for it, the parens themselves are not necessary anymore (Hey, 
     you got your Python in my Perl!), so something like this is fine:
        if True { say "It's true!" }
