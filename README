INSTALLING {
    
    $ git clone git@github.com:tadzik/rakudobrew.git ~/.rakudobrew

    $ rakudobrew init
        This produces output, telling you how to auto-initialize on login.  
        Presumably the instructions given will init rakudo without producing 
        the pesky output.

        However, the instructions given are for bash, and I don't know enough 
        fish to be able to translate the bash command to fish.

        So for now, I'm going to accept that rakudobrew does not get 
        initialized automatically on login, and just init it once per session 
        myself until I find a better solution.

    $ rakudobrew build moar
        Builds and installs the MoarVM.  It doesn't matter where you're 
        sitting on the filesystem when you do this.  Takes a few minutes.

    $ rakudobrew build-panda
        Builds and installs panda.  YES, THE HYPHEN NEEDS TO BE THERE.  Yes, 
        it's inconsistent.  Panda seems to be the rakudo moral equivalent of 
        cpan.  Takes a few minutes, less than building moar.

    $ panda install Task::Star
        "Meta-package for modules included in Rakudo Star"

        This produced an error on installing Grammar::Debugger.  Task::Star is 
        a list of modules to install, and I'm concerned that the entire list 
        stopped getting installed when the Grammar::Debugger error was 
        encountered.

        If you find that you need other modules that should have been included 
        in Task::Star but didn't get installed because of the 
        Grammar::Debugger explosion, you can install them individually as 
        needed:
            $ panda install JSON::Tiny
            $ panda install HTTP::Easy
            etc

    Anyway, Task::Star error aside, "perl6" should now be in your path.
        $ which perl6
        /home/jon/.rakudobrew/bin/perl6
        
        
}
