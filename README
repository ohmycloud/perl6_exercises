I've worked my way through
    http://doc.perl6.org/language.html
For the most part, each section linked that page has its own subdirectory 
under ./tutorials/perl6/


Re-reading tutorials_blogs/perl6/concurrency/ to get promises and supplies 
more firmly in my head.  Pick up on channels.


REFERENCE {#{{{
    
    http://perl6intro.com/

    I've got this listed below, but don't use it enough.  It's not a full 
    reference, but it's nicely laid out, and when you're doing that "shit I 
    can't remember how to do X" thing, you can often find X here.

}#}}}
pragma {#{{{
    
    You can start your p6 program with:
            use v6;

    That has no effect if you run the thing with perl6.  But if you 
    accidentally invoke it as
            $ perl scriptname.p6

    It'll bomb out because you tried running it through p5.  It probably would 
    have bombed out anyway, but I guess there's a chance with a tiny script 
    that it'd be syntactically valid for p5 as well as p6.


    Upshot is that I'm generally not bothering with this, but you can if you 
    like.

TUTORIALS, DOCS, WEBSITES {#{{{

    http://doc.perl6.org/language.html
        This page is a list of links to different perl6 tutorials and docs 
        sites.  Looks pretty useful.

        The whole "doc.perl6.org" is pretty damn useful :)

    http://perl6intro.com/
        A nice-looking intro tutorial that I want to go through after 
        finishing going through the main docs.

        Not as thorough as a full-on tutorial, but a very good introduction, 
        well laid-out.  When you're trying to remember how to do something 
        simple that you just can't remember the syntax for and the full 
        tutorial is proving hard to search, this is a good resource.

        He has a lot of p6-related articles, many of them how-tos.  Good place 
        to start.

        I've covered all of his entries up to "Signatures, Part 2" (Feb 5).  
        His articles are good, check back here periodically to see if he's 
        posted new stuff.

FAQ, Glossary ***CHECK*** {#{{{

    There's a FAQ section that I'm not going to repeat here, because it's 
    really not "tutorial-y", but it has lots of little FAQ-y bits of info that 
    I should go through.
        http://doc.perl6.org/language/faq

    Same deal with the Glossary section.  Lots of the words there are general 
    Perl* terms (eg DWIM, Damian Conway, etc), but there are some that are 
    p6-specific, so at least glance through.

INSTALL HISTORY {#{{{

    "perl6 -v" from different versions I've installed.
    
    - 01/07/2017
This is Rakudo version 2015.12-136-ga84d4ed built on MoarVM version 2015.12
implementing Perl 6.c.
        
        - I moved v6.b to ~/.rakudobrew_orig/ when I installed v6.c.
    
    - ~12/2015
This is rakudo version 2015.11-357-g587f700 built on MoarVM version 2015.11-34-gc3eea17 implementing Perl v6.b.

}#}}}
UNIMPLEMENTED *** {
    Jan 16
        This is Rakudo version 2016.01.1 built on MoarVM version 2016.01

    I'm starting to play with perl6 before the Xmas 2015 official production 
    release.
        This is rakudo version 2015.11-357-g587f700 built on MoarVM version 2015.11-34-gc3eea17 implementing Perl v6.b.

    I'm finding things that aren't doing what the docs tell me they should; 
    I'm going to just assume those things will be fixed eventually

    Ack for "NYI" for things that fit this bill.  Hopefully as new rakudo 
    versions come out, the number of NYI marks will decrease.

}
CHEC.K {
    
    I'm adding CHEC.K marks (without the period) for things that I want to 
    come back and look at again, but which don't satisfy NYI.

}
