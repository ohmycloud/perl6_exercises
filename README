I'm working through
    http://doc.perl6.org/language.html

...and I just now realized, because I'm a fucking moron, that the docs are 
listed alphabetically, not in "you should follow them in this order" order.  
I'm going throw them as listed anyway just so I can keep track.

Left off at
    Grammars (don't skip this.)


INSTALLING {#{{{
    http://rakudo.org/how-to-get-rakudo/

    I didn't want to go with the Ubuntu package, figuring it'd probably be 
    out-of-date.  I do like perlbrew, and one of the options for perl6 is 
    "rakudobrew", so figured I'd go with that instead of doing a full manual 
    build.


    $ git clone git@github.com:tadzik/rakudobrew.git ~/.rakudobrew
        - add ~/.rakudobrew/bin/ to your PATH

    - If you pulled my latest fish config file from github and started a new 
      shell, you can skip this next step; it's in that file.
        $ rakudobrew init
            This produces output, telling you how to auto-initialize on login.  
            Presumably the instructions given will init rakudo without 
            producing the pesky output.

    $ rakudobrew build moar
        Builds and installs the MoarVM.  It doesn't matter where you're 
        sitting on the filesystem when you do this.  Takes a few minutes.

    $ rakudobrew build-panda
        Builds and installs panda.  YES, THE HYPHEN NEEDS TO BE THERE.  Yes, 
        it's inconsistent.  Panda seems to be the rakudo moral equivalent of 
        cpan.  Takes a few minutes, less than building moar.

    $ panda install Task::Star
        "Meta-package for modules included in Rakudo Star"

        This produced an error on installing Grammar::Debugger.  Task::Star is 
        a list of modules to install, and I'm concerned that the entire list 
        stopped getting installed when the Grammar::Debugger error was 
        encountered.

        Task::Star comes from here:
            https://github.com/tadzik/Task-Star
        You can see the list of modules it's supposed to install in META.info.

        If you find that you need other modules that should have been included 
        in Task::Star but didn't get installed because of the 
        Grammar::Debugger explosion, you can install them individually as 
        needed:
            $ panda install JSON::Tiny
            $ panda install HTTP::Easy
            etc

    Anyway, Task::Star errors aside, "perl6" should now be in your path.
        $ which perl6
        /home/jon/.rakudobrew/bin/perl6
        
    Test!
        $ perl6 hello.p6
        Hello, World!

        Yay!

TUTORIALS {#{{{

    This page is a list of links to different perl6 tutorials and docs sites.  
    Looks pretty useful.

FAQ, Glossary ***CHECK*** {#{{{

    There's a FAQ section that I'm not going to repeat here, because it's 
    really not "tutorial-y", but it has lots of little FAQ-y bits of info that 
    I should go through.
        http://doc.perl6.org/language/faq

    Same deal with the Glossary section.  Lots of the words there are general 
    Perl* terms (eg DWIM, Damian Conway, etc), but there are some that are 
    p6-specific, so at least glance through.
        http://doc.perl6.org/language/glossary

UNIMPLEMENTED *** {
    I'm starting to play with perl6 before the Xmas 2015 official production 
    release.
        This is rakudo version 2015.11-357-g587f700 built on MoarVM version 2015.11-34-gc3eea17 implementing Perl v6.b.

    I'm finding things that aren't doing what the docs tell me they should; 
    I'm going to just assume those things will be fixed in v1.0.

    Ack for "NYI" for things that fit this bill.
}
CHEC.K {
    
    I'm adding CHEC.K marks (without the period) for things that I want to 
    come back and look at again, but which don't satisfy NYI.

}
