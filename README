I've worked my way through
    http://doc.perl6.org/language.html
For the most part, each section linked that page has its own subdirectory 
under ./tutorials/perl6/



Re-reading tutorials_blogs/perl6/concurrency/ to get promises and supplies 
more firmly in my head.  Pick up on channels.

Finish reading the advent calendar entry linked in 
tutorials_blogs/perl6/junction/README.  I left off at the section on regexes.




Currently taking a break from tutorials and working on projects/lacuna.

shebang {# {{{
#!/usr/bin/env perl6
#!/home/jon/.rakudo/install/bin/perl6

    All of the code written before 02/22/2016 will have the old rakudobrew 
    shebang, and won't work anymore once you switch to built-from-source 
    rakudo.  Change those shebangs.

    I've been using explicit shebangs up till now, but it probably makes more 
    sense to just use env:
        #!/usr/bin/env perl6

    Current, building rakudo from source:
        #!/home/jon/.rakudo/install/bin/perl6

    Orig, using rakudobrew:
        #!/home/jon/.rakudobrew/bin/perl6

INSTALLING {#{{{
    http://rakudo.org/how-to-get-rakudo/

    I didn't want to go with the Ubuntu package, figuring it'd probably be 
    out-of-date (most Rakudo docs seem to support that idea).

    Rakudobrew {#{{{

        https://github.com/tadzik/rakudobrew

        $ git clone git@github.com:tadzik/rakudobrew.git ~/.rakudobrew
            - add ~/.rakudobrew/bin/ to your PATH

        - If you pulled my latest fish config file from github and started a new 
        shell, you can skip this next step; it's in that file.
            $ rakudobrew init
                This produces output, telling you how to auto-initialize on login.  
                Presumably the instructions given will init rakudo without 
                producing the pesky output.

        $ rakudobrew build moar
            Builds and installs the MoarVM.  It doesn't matter where you're 
            sitting on the filesystem when you do this.  Takes a few minutes.

        $ rakudobrew build-panda
            Builds and installs panda.  YES, THE HYPHEN NEEDS TO BE THERE.  Yes, 
            it's inconsistent.  Panda seems to be the rakudo moral equivalent of 
            cpan.  Takes a few minutes, less than building moar.

        $ panda install Task::Star
            "Meta-package for modules included in Rakudo Star"

            In my first rakudo installation (v6.b), this produced an error on 
            installing Grammar::Debugger.  Task::Star is a list of modules to 
            install, and I'm concerned that the entire list stopped getting 
            installed when the Grammar::Debugger error was encountered.


            However, in my second rakudo installation (v6.c, the Christmas 2015 
            "production-ready" perl6), installing Task::Star worked without issue, 
            so the rest of this note became unnecessary.


            Task::Star comes from here:
                https://github.com/tadzik/Task-Star
            You can see the list of modules it's supposed to install in META.info.

            If you find that you need other modules that should have been included 
            in Task::Star but didn't get installed because of the 
            Grammar::Debugger explosion, you can install them individually as 
            needed:
                $ panda install JSON::Tiny
                $ panda install HTTP::Easy
                etc

        Anyway, Task::Star errors aside, "perl6" should now be in your path.
            $ which perl6
            /home/jon/.rakudobrew/bin/perl6
            
        Test!
            $ perl6 hello.p6
            Hello, World!

            Yay!

    Star {#{{{

        - Download the latest from
                http://rakudo.org/downloads/star/
            - Just download it to your home directory and untar it right 
              there.
        - If ~/.rakudo exists, back it up.
        - Move the un-tarred rakudo-star-yyyy.mm dir to ~/.rakudo/

        - Do the following:
            $ cd ~/.rakudo/
            $ perl Configure.pl --backend=moar --gen-moar
                - Took 1-2 minutes on samwise, 1 minute on gandalf
                - Some warnings/errors will probably occur.  That's OK, let it 
                  go.
            $ make
                - ~4 minutes on samwise, 1:30 on gandalf
            $ make install
                - This doesn't just install, it also goes on to (presumably, 
                  download first, and then) compile a bunch of modules (p6 
                  core, maybe?).
                - ~5 minutes on gandalf


        - My config.fish file has that ~/.rakudo/ dir in its PATH
            - There are actually 2 subdirs that need to be in the PATH; 
              they're both there.
            - Make sure you've got my latest fish config setup pulled from 
              github, and your terminal should be able to find perl6.

pragma {#{{{
    
    You can start your p6 program with:
            use v6;

    That has no effect if you run the thing with perl6.  But if you 
    accidentally invoke it as
            $ perl scriptname.p6

    It'll bomb out because you tried running it through p5.  It probably would 
    have bombed out anyway, but I guess there's a chance with a tiny script 
    that it'd be syntactically valid for p5 as well as p6.


    Upshot is that I'm generally not bothering with this, but you can if you 
    like.

TUTORIALS, DOCS {#{{{

    http://doc.perl6.org/language.html
        This page is a list of links to different perl6 tutorials and docs 
        sites.  Looks pretty useful.

        The whole "doc.perl6.org" is pretty damn useful :)

        A nice-looking intro tutorial that I want to go through after

        He has a lot of p6-related articles, many of them how-tos.  Good place

        I've covered all of his entries up to "Signatures, Part 2" (Feb 5).  
        His articles are good, check back here periodically to see if he's

FAQ, Glossary ***CHECK*** {#{{{

    There's a FAQ section that I'm not going to repeat here, because it's 
    really not "tutorial-y", but it has lots of little FAQ-y bits of info that 
    I should go through.
        http://doc.perl6.org/language/faq

    Same deal with the Glossary section.  Lots of the words there are general 
    Perl* terms (eg DWIM, Damian Conway, etc), but there are some that are 
    p6-specific, so at least glance through.

UNIMPLEMENTED *** {
    Jan 16
        This is Rakudo version 2016.01.1 built on MoarVM version 2016.01

    I'm starting to play with perl6 before the Xmas 2015 official production 
    release.
        This is rakudo version 2015.11-357-g587f700 built on MoarVM version 2015.11-34-gc3eea17 implementing Perl v6.b.

    I'm finding things that aren't doing what the docs tell me they should; 
    I'm going to just assume those things will be fixed eventually

    Ack for "NYI" for things that fit this bill.  Hopefully as new rakudo 
    versions come out, the number of NYI marks will decrease.

}
CHEC.K {
    
    I'm adding CHEC.K marks (without the period) for things that I want to 
    come back and look at again, but which don't satisfy NYI.

}
