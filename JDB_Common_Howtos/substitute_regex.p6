### Non-destructive;

    say "Orig: $str";
    say "New:  $new";

### Method form
{
    my $str = "foobar";
    my $new = $str.subst: 'foo', 'FOO';
    say "Orig: $str";
    say "New:  $new";
    ''.say;

### Captures
{
    ### The RHS can take a Callable.
    my $str = "foobar";

    ### Both do the same thing.
    #my $new = $str.subst: /(...)(bar)/, -> { $0.uc ~ $1 };
    my $new = $str.subst: /(...)/, -> { $0.uc };

    say "Orig: $str";
    say "New:  $new";
    ''.say;
