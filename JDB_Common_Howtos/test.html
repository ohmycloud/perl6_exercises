<section><h1>Displaying</h1>
<p>You can pass the --doc arg to perl6 to see the Pod in here: $ perl6 --doc POD.p6</p>
<p>But I&#39;ve also dicked with the shebang line in here, so just executing this $ ./POD.p6 will do the same thing.</p>
<p>To produce HTML documentation: $ perl6 --doc=HTML &gt; output.html This requires that you have Pod::To::HTML installed (use panda).</p>
<p>My guess is that you can produce any type of output as long as you have  the correct Pod::To::&lt;whatever&gt; module installed.</p>
<p>This section gets displayed, including the newlines, because it&#39;s a  begin/end section.</p>
</section>
<section><h1>Name</h1>
<p>It looks like we&#39;re now officially calling it &quot;Pod&quot;, rather than POD. https://design.perl6.org/S26.html</p>
</section>
<section><h1>Howto</h1>
<p>This is an example of a Paragraph block. It ends at the first blank line,  with no need for an ending Pod command.</p>
</section>
<section><h1>Indentation</h1>
<p>I tend to indent as you can see throughout, though it&#39;s not necessary.</p>
</section>
<section><h1>AnotherParagraphBlock</h1>
<p>This is just another paragraph block that does get displayed.</p>

<h1 id="This_is_an_'abbreviated_block'."><a class="u" href="#___top" title="go to top of document">This is an &#39;abbreviated block&#39;.</a></h1>
<section><h1>InternalPod</h1>
<h1 id="Internal_Header"><a class="u" href="#___top" title="go to top of document">Internal Header</a></h1>
<p>Our =begin and =end names must be one word. &quot;InternalPod&quot; is OK, but  &quot;Internal Pod&quot; is not.</p>
<p>Also, it looks like we can indent our pod now, and we don&#39;t need blank  vertical lines around the individual Pod specifiers.</p>
<p>Actually, it looks like indented text is meant to be a code block.</p>
<p>my $foo = &#39;bar&#39;;</p>
<p>However, there&#39;s no visual difference between this sentence and the previous  chunk of &quot;code&quot; in either the CLI or HTML output, so I&#39;m just going to go back  to indenting all of my text because it looks nicer in the source.</p>
<p>Look - no =over or =back needed!</p>

<section><h1>DeclaratorBlocks</h1>
<p>&#39;#|&#39; documents the declaration on the following line.</p>
<p>I think that you&#39;re supposed to be able to use these declarator blocks to  document attributes as well as classes and methods, but for now at least,  the output looks bad enough that I&#39;ve skipped doing it.</p>
<p>The Pod::To::HTML module is (hopefully) not in its final state, because  the declarator blocks below look like absolute dogshit in HTML right now. You can supposedly</p>

<h1>Person: Represents a person. Can I do this on multiple lines? Yes, I can!</h1><article>
<code>greet:(Person $: *%_)</code>:
Says hello to our Person. This curly brace thing is another way to do a declarator block with multiple lines. And my newly-updated perl6.vim file can deal with it!

<section><h1>FormattingCodes</h1>
<p><strong>This should be bold.</strong></p>
<p><code>my $str = &quot;This should look like code.&quot;;</code></p>
<p><em>This should be in italics.</em></p>
<p><strong>We can now nest <em>formatting codes inside</em> other formatting codes.</strong></p>
<p>You can use multiple angle brackets as your <strong>delimiters</strong>. Angle-bracket  delimited code can contain stuff with the same number of angle brackets or  fewer, but not more.</p>
<p>So if we wanted to show some hash access code, these would be legal:</p>
<p><code>say $foo&lt;bar&gt; </code></p>
<p>Here, the separation between Pod and code is easier to see. <code>say $foo&lt;bar&gt; </code></p>
<p>But we could not do this, because we&#39;re containing more angles than we used in  our delimiters - the output is all mucked up: <code>@foo </code>&gt; .meth &gt;</p>
