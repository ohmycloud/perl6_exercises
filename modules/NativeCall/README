NativeCall is part of the standard p6 distribution, and allows you to make 
calls out to functions defined in accessible C libraries.

Standard Library {#{{{
    With no arguments, the function you're trying to access is assumed to be 
    in the standard library.

    see ./fork.p6
}#}}}
Some other library {#{{{
    When using functions from other-than-the-standard-library, we have to tell 
    NativeCall which library the functions come from

    See ./cd_troll.p6.
}#}}}


libcsv {
    
    https://sourceforge.net/projects/libcsv/?source=typ_redirect

    INSTALL:
        ./configure --libdir=/usr/lib
            Otherwise it wants to install into /usr/local/lib and NativeCall 
            apparently does not look in there.
        make
        make check
        sudo make install

}
