INSTALL {#{{{

    Requires libncurses.so in /usr/lib.  At work, all I had to do was
        panda install NCurses

    But it's likely I'd already installed libncurses at some point in the 
    past.  So if the panda install above doesn't work, start with
        sudo apt-get install libncurses5

    and then panda update and try the panda install again.



    If you've got libncurses.so on your machine somewhere other than /usr/lib, 
    you can specify its location by setting PERL6_NCURSES_LIB env var.
