There is a YAML module, but it only has a dump method, no load (so it can 
write yaml but not read it, which is utterly useless).

YAMLish can't parse the example YAML file given on the YAML website
    http://www.yaml.org/start.html
which is not great news.

However, I don't need all of the funk in that example, so I've pared it down 
to what's in "in.yml", and YAMLish _can_ parse that.


And although I can see a bunch of to-yaml() multi subs declared in the YAMLish 
source, none of them are being exported, so I can't use them.
