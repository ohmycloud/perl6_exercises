Synopsis 26 - Documentation
    http://design.perl6.org/S26.html




Very much of the stuff in the Synopsis is simply not happening in practice.

./test.p6 contains a bunch of different pod blocks and some output code at the 
end to ensure the pod isn't interfering with code.

See the commands in "Displaying POD".  Note the output, both CLI and HTML, 
just doesn't match what the POD synopsis says should happen much of the time.




Prereqs {#{{{
    
    OK, not really a prereq, but you're going to want it, so install:
            $ panda install Pod::To::HTML

}#}}}
Displaying POD {#{{{

    Stop typing "perldoc" you moron.  That's running my p5 perldoc, which is 
    confused about the p6 version of POD.
            $ perl6 --doc <script or module name>


    As long as you have Pod::To::HTML installed, you can do:
            $ perl6 --doc=HTML <script or module name> > output.html

}#}}}
