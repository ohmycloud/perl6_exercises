Be sure that the perl5 you're using right now is "shared_5.22.2" before trying 
to mess with any Inline::Perl5 stuff.

Scripts {
    
    - dancer_test.p6
    - csv_test.p6
        - Read in that order.
        - They both work fine, but the code is a little clunky.

    - md5_test.p6
        - Gets rid of the $p5 object altogether
        - Actually imports a Perl5 module which is then usable from within the 
          perl6 script, and using perl6 syntax.

    - subclassing.p6
        - about 13.22 in the video
        - Doesn't actually do anything, just shows that your p6 class can 
          subclass a p5 class.

    He mentions that this is currently pretty bleading edge and he wouldn't 
    use it in production, but good to be able to see the example.

INSTALL {#{{{
    

When you install (and presumably when you go to use) Inline::Perl5, you have 
to be using a Perl5 built with -Duseshrplib.

There's a recent thread on Perlmonks where a guy says he got Inline::Perl5 
installed via panda using perl 5.22.0.  5.22.2 is currently available via 
perlbrew, so now I'm trying that.
    perlbrew install perl-5.22.2 -Duseshrplib --as shared_5.22.2

Success!




I originally tried to install 5.24 that way:
    perlbrew install perl-5.24.0 -Duseshrplib --as shared_5.24.0

After installing and using that as my active perl5, the "panda install 
Inline::Perl5" still took a shit.  It produced this in an infinite loop:
    (in cleanup) Method 'DESTROY' not found for invocant of class 'X::Method::NotFound' at (eval 1) line 16 during global destruction.
    (in cleanup) Method 'DESTROY' not found for invocant of class 'X::Method::NotFound' at (eval 1) line 16 during global destruction.
    (in cleanup) Method 'DESTROY' not found for invocant of class 'X::Method::NotFound' at (eval 1) line 16 during global destruction.

    (in cleanup) Method 'DESTROY' not found for invocant of class 'X::Method::NotFound' at (eval 1) line 16 during global destruction.
    ...

After seeing that, and finding the perlmonks thread re: 5.22, I switched.
