Supposed to be an in-browser editor of some sort, but 03/04/2016 it installs 
but doesn't work (complains about not being able to find farabi.js).

Based on this p5 module:
    https://metacpan.org/pod/Farabi




I did also install the p5 module in my 5.18 perlbrew.  Both p5 and p6 modules 
install an exe named simply "farabi".

So if 5.18 is active, "$ farabi" will fire off the p5 version.  If you want to 
play with the p6 version, just have perlbrew use a p5 version other than 5.18.

That 5.18 version of farabi does work.  It's interesting, but probably not 
something I'd ever use in anger.
