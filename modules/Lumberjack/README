INSTALLING {#{{{
    - panda install Lumberjack
        - This failed.
        - In checking the errors, it complained about missing Staticish.

    - panda install Staticish
        - This worked fine.

    - panda install Lumberjack
        - This time, it worked fine.

    It looks like some part of the panda environment needs some work with re: 
    prereqs.  But not the end of the world.
