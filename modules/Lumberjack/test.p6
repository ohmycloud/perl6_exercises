use Lumberjack;

### This is copypasta from the SYNOPSIS, and doesn't  work.
# Output to $*ERR by default - in colour!
Lumberjack.dispatchers.append: Lumberjack::Dispatcher::Console.new(:colours);


### No need to go any further at this point.  The Synopsis is about all the 
### docs provided, and the first line of the thing is wrong.
###
### Also, the section following the Synopsis is "Descriptiom" [sic].
### 
###
###
###
### From the rest of the example code listed in the Synopsis, this looks like 
### it could be reasonably usable, it just doesn't work yet. 
###
### The whole module looks like it was mostly worked on in just the past two 
### weeks (actually started in Aug 2015, but only a little work on it then and 
### not touched again until two weeks ago).  So the module is still quite new 
### and will hopefully be updated.
