Investigating as a replacement for Config::Simple, which broke with the 
04/2016 Rakudo update.


05/11/2016
This module now includes a to-toml() function, which it didn't before, so it 
once again looks useful.


NEWLINE GOTCHA {#{{{
    I can read the config file using slurp(), and pass the resulting string to 
    from-toml() to get a hash out of it.  Great.

    However, this does not work:
            spurt $config_file, to-toml(%config);

    That's because to-toml() does not append a newline to the end of the 
    string it produces, which means that the $config_file ends up without a 
    final newline.  So the next time I try to parse that same file, 
    from-toml() will produce a "failed to parse" exception -- that final 
    newline is required.

    So, when writing, just get a filehandle and write to that using say():
            my $fh = $config_file.IO.open :w;
            $fh.say( to-toml(%config) );
}#}}}
