I was using this for the config file for my lacuna project.  But the April 
2016 Rakudo update broke Data::Dump, which is being used by Config::Simple, so 
it broke as well.

Config::TOML does install under this new Rakudo, and its config file syntax is 
similar enough to the INI format I was using with Config::Simple, so I'm now 
looking at switching to that.
