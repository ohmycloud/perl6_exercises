There are a bunch of different candidates here.



I'd prefer Config::Simple, since it allows INI format, and both reads and 
writes.     

I was using it, but it hasn't been updated since January and it now fails its 
own tests.


Config::TOML's format is vaguely similar to INI format, and it allows both 
reads and writes, so that's probably what you want.
